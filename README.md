# network-event
A networking "game" that enables every participant of an event to meet every other participant exactly once.

---

## Background
I've been to many different types of events – conferences, meetups, and the like – and one of the biggest problems I've encountered at each was meeting new people.

As a huge introvert, introducing myself to "random strangers" in such a setting has always been challenging.

I've always hoped for someone or something to break the ice for me, so that I can meet new people with common interests – after all, we're all at the same event for a purpose.

This "game" is just a simple algorithm that enables every participant of the event to meet every other participant exactly once within a set time limit; i.e. it enables everyone to network.

This breaks the ice for everyone and introduces everyone to everyone else.

## What do you need?
- An area in which people can move around. Preferably a single large room or a hall.
- Up to 7 spots for up to 7 people to gather around at, with some space between each group. It's recommended to use standing tables, if you're able.

## Rules
1. Every participant of the networking event gets a single number.
2. In each round, the participant's location is determined by the number.
3. Each participant must move between rounds to their new location for the round.
4. The participants remain at the location until the round ends.
5. There are no points or winners and losers in this networking event. Every participant is a winner.

## Preparation
1. Determine the maximum number of people that would participate in the networking event. If you have 16/25/49 or fewer participants, use the version for 16/25/49 people. If you have 50 or more participants, split them down into smaller groups of up to 25 or 49 people. Note: in this case people will only meet people in the same group. Creating an event for a larger group would make the event last too long. If you're unsure how many participants you'd have, use one version bigger or default to the version for 49 people.
2. Print out the appropriate tickets for people and letters for the tables.
3. Determine the length of each round. 5-10 minutes is the recommended length. Multiply the round length with the number of rounds to get the length of the event.
4. Determine what the participants will be doing during the round. See examples lower down, but it's up to the organizer to figure out what would be fun for the participants to do in the alloted time.

## Event
1. Prepare everything for the event: print out the tickets and the cards for the tables, prepare the venue and spots for groups, gather the participants.
2. Explain the rules to the participants.
3. Starting from the number 1 and going in the ascending order, give each participant a single ticket.
4. Have every participant move to their designated table by reading the order aloud or using a different signalization method.
5. Start the timer.
6. After the round ends, all participants move to their location for the next round. Again, either read the new locations for each aloud or use a different signalization method.

## Examples of what do to during a round
- Everyone has to introduce themselves to everyone else and share one cool or interesting thing about them.
- Everyone comments on the lectures from the conference, meetup, or whatever this networking event is happening at.
- Prepare at least 10-20 questions for each table. In every round, participants have to answer some of the questions on the table. It's best to use questions that spark conversation, and not the questions with right or wrong answer. The goal is not to answer all questions, but to have a great time.

## Real example of an event
1. A conference has about 50 participants, but not everyone will participate in the networking event. So we use the version for 49 people.
2.  We prepare 7 tables and mark each with a letter from A to G. The distance between each table is at least 3 meters.
3.  On each table, we place a set of 20-something questions. It doesn't have to be the same number, but it should be close.
4.  It's decided that each round will last 7 minutes. Since there's 8 rounds, the networking event will last about an hour, i.e. 56 minutes if there's no breaks.
5.  All participants are standing away from the tables.
6.  Each participant gets a number, starting from 1 and reaching up to 45, since that's how many people decided to participate in the networking event
7.  Participants with numbers 1 to 7 are pointed to the appopriate A to G tables, since they'll spend the majority of the networking event at the same location
8.  Participants with numbers 8 to 45 are pointed to the appropriate tables, as per the numbers on the backs of their tickets. Each participant can even verify their location by looking at the card on the table, which also lists the numbers that need to be present for each round
9.  The first round officially starts and everyone begins answering questions from the papers on the table. The organizer repeats to everyone that the goal is to discuss their answers, not answer all questions
10.  After 7 minutes, the organizer calls for the end of the round and instructs everyone to move to the appropriate table for round 2
11.  This is repeated until all rounds are done
12.  After the networking event, people continue talking to people they haven't known before the event itself. Mission complete.
